## Useful MATLAB functions

This git project was adapted from a much earlier project that had various files
that proved useful across many different projects, computers, and accounts.
That project established a pattern for controlling third-party, open-source
files from disparate sources.  Most non-MATLAB content was removed.

## Criteria for inclusion

Items will be included in this repository provided:

- inclusion is requested by pull request,
- proposed patches document a suitable open source license,
- code quality/function is sufficient to permit reliable usage.

## Licenses for items from third parties

Most of the contents of this project were written by others and are grouped in
subfolders according to the licenses, under which they were shared.

Where individual files do not have licenses included in the source, the licenses
are included with names such license_<filename>.txt for a file named
<filename>.m

Licenses include:
- The 2-Clause BSD License (bsd_2_clause)
- The GNU General Public License v2.0 (gpl_v2_0)

leave a voice message indicating that you are calling about the "Thinhorn third
party MATLAB github project" and providing your contact information so that
